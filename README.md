# What This Is
This mod is intended to make adding secluded dungeons to the game significantly easier by adding the more tedious features (such as portals, placement rules, etc) so that users do not have to.

As of writing this, the mod is being written using MCreator, and I apologize for that, but I will gladly accept any suggestions or corrections from more competent mod developers. My goal is to make this as functional for general use as possible.
